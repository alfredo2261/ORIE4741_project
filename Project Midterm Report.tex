1 Introduction

As energy utilities expand the deployment of smart meters in the US,
privacy of personal data is acquiring greater concern. In the possession
of an adversary, power consumption data could reveal a user's residence
occupancy and routine aggregate power and appliance usage trends. The
expansion of the Ubiquitous Power Internet of Things (UPIoT), which
oftentimes incorporates low-cost smart metering equipment and less
secure data transmission, further increases privacy concerns. These
privacy concerns create a lack of trust between UPIoT device users and
device distributors, discouraging users from participating in
large-scale energy feedback systems. Thus far, privacy has been explored
in the context of home appliance manufacturing and Distributed Energy
Resources, but to the best of my knowledge, very little work has been
done to explore decentralized privacy in the context of energy
disaggregation. Federated learning is a decentralized machine learning
technique that trains a learning model on user's devices locally without
sharing personal data. In the context of the UPIoT, federated learning
can be utilized as a means to better ensure user privacy. Specifically,
in the context of energy disaggregation, wherein aggregate power
consumption data are used to make predictions on appliance specific
energy trends without the need for the installation of physical,
oftentimes costly and intrusive appliance-level submetering equipment,
federated learning creates an opportunity for UPIoT device users to feel
secure in sharing data, enabling more contributors to develop energy
disaggregation models while creating more generalized models.

2 Data Set

For the purpose of this study, I am exploring the Pecan Street Dataset
through Dataport that offers circuit and grid-level power consumption
data for more than 1,000 volunteer homes across the United States. Of
these 1,000 homes, I currently have access to data for 79 of them in New
York for the month of May. The dataset contains a column called
``dataid'', which allows me to differentiate between each building, as
well as 1-minute interval timestamps for power consumption readings
along with power consumption data measured in kiloWatts for 77 different
metered devices. I also have access to a metadata file that explains the
meaning of each device and classifies each of the 79 buildings by
use-type; Single Family Home, Townhome or Apartment. I have recently
requested a broader dataset that will grant me access to data from
February, 2019 to October, 2020 for 104 homes in New York. Taking into
account feedback from my proposal peer review suggesting I use a larger
dataset, I believe this dataset will be more suitable for my purposes
since it contains a larger and more diverse set of homes as well as
1-minute interval data for almost 2 years as opposed to 1 month.

3 Data Cleaning

At first glance, the dataset seemed very large and messy, with over
400,000 examples and 79 features. Looking deeper into the data, it
seemed even messier, wherein each building submeters a different set of
devices, creating many fields of missing data. For the purpose of
testing an energy disaggregation model built using one building on other
buildings, the same appliance must be compared and this disparity in
devices created a challenge. In cleaning my data, I deleted any features
that were filled completely with missing values, then changed any
remaining missing values to 0. The feature of aggregate building power
was not directly available at first and it was necessary to add grid
power with any solar power submetered to obtain the feature ``total
aggregate building power''. I created a function to separate buildings
by ``dataid'' so that I could generate testing and training sets on
individual houeholds, since they cannot be created on all the data at
once. I created the histogram displayed in Figure 1 to get an idea of
the frequency of appliances available and found that ``kitchenapp1'',
``kitchenapp2'', and ``dishwasher1'' appeared most frequently amongst
the buildings.

4 Preliminary Analysis

I experimented with creating a linear regression model for my initial
analysis. I let \(X \in R^{nx1}\) be my training feature for an
individual house, consisting of the buildings ``total aggregate building
power''. I let \(Y \in R^{d}\) be my training label, consisting of the
buildings appliance level power consumption. I let \(w \in R^{d}\) be my
linear model coefficients generated using ordinary least squares.

My linear regression model was generated for one building to predict the
power consumption of ``kitchenapp1'' from the buildings total power
consumption. 80\% of the available data was used to create the training
set while the remaining 20\% was used to create the test set. The
results seemed promising, producing a testing mean squared error of
0.00449 \(kW^2\) and a training mean squared error of 0.004187 \(kW^2\).
However, after plotting my results, I observed the predictions
relatively followed the appliance power consumption trend, but did not
capture sudden spikes in power consumption. Additionally, for the
majority of the time, the power consumption for this device was very low
and close to zero, which I thought might be why the error was so low. To
test if this was true, I built another linear regression model on
another device, ``lights\_plugs1'', which are the lights in a building
and tend to use poewr more often than kitchen appliances. To my
surprise, they once again showed a low training and testing error of
0.00414 and 0.00559 \(kW^2\) respectively. Though the error was low,
sudden spikes in power consumption again were not always captured
correctly.

5 Future Work

I want to continue exploring other methods to capture these spikes in
power consumption. My overall goal is to create a model trustworthy
enough for building managers to feel safe in its use, and this requires
greater accuracy for these sudden spikes. I am considering making this
into a binary classification problem, where device states of ``on'' and
``off'' are predicted and incorporating a balanced error rate to
penalize heavily on instances where the model incorrectly classifies. To
avoid overfitting, I plan to perform cross validation with a subset of
my data. This will be easier to achieve once I obtain the larger dataset
of 104 buildings.

Additionally, my next step is to incorporate federated learning into my
model. Aside from obtaining an accurate model for making energy
disaggregation predictions, I want to be able to preserve user privacy
when transmitting data from the UPIoT device user end to the device
distributor that will perform the disaggregation. I plan to use the
Tensorflow federated package to implement privacy preserving techniques,
and then optimize the accuracy-privacy tradeoff to provide the user with
the most accurate energy disaggregation data in the most
privacy-respecting manner.
