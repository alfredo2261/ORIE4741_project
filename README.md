Project name:
Privacy Preserving Energy Disaggregation

Project description:
This project will focus on applying privacy preserving energy disaggregation to the Pecan Street dataset through Dataport. I plan to test various data-driven learning techniques to the dataset to find the most accurate method of performing energy disaggregation. I then plan to test various privacy preserving techniques on the generated models to find which allows for the best performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. I will explore the feasability of generating one generalizeable model and will consider developing multiple models for different classifications of building types if this is impossible. My overall goal is to allow building users to benefit the most from their smart metering equipment while maintaining the greatest level of user privacy.
